OMGWTFADD was originally coded in C++/OpenGL by Dave Wilkinson, Lindsey Bieda, and Bradley D. Kuhlman, taking first place in the PittGeeks 2nd Annual Open Source Game Coding Competition. This is a javascript remix using the HTML5 canvas element.

The game begins with 30 seconds of Tetris play, then the board rotates &pi; for 30 seconds of Breakout play. If the ball misses the paddle, all bricks drop one spot.

To play, javascript must be enabled, and your browser must support the <code>canvas</code> element.

I started this project to learn more about canvas and jQuery, and in that respect it has been a huge success. Please keep in mind that this project is not finished. There is no end-game yet, and there are some collision bugs. I don't think the pieces rotate correctly. I'll add scorekeeping as soon as I figure out how to draw text on canvas.

Firefox users may encounter some lag due to not using WebKit :p and some issues with holding down keypresses. Chrome and Safari are recommended.
